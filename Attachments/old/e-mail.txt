yes sir! I was planning on calling you this afternoon. The jury deliberated
until 7pm last night.

Guilty on DUI, careless driving, reckless driving, hit and run, leaving the
scene of an accident. Not guilty of reckless driving.

Mr. Williams was remanded into custody after trial and is going to be
sentenced on 02/03/2013 at 11:30 am. If you would like to be present at
sentencing and talk to the judge, you are more than welcome. He is looking
at at least 60 days in jail for the DUI alone since it is his third
conviction.

Thank you so much for your testimony Mr. Farley. We wouldn't have been able
to get the conviction without it. Feel free to contact me in teh future for
any questions.

Chelsea Burtis
